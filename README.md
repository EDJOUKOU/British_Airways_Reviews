# British_Airways_Reviews
A visualization project using Tableau

## Project Overview
This project develops a comprehensive dashboard to analyze key service parameters—Cabin Staff Service, Entertainment, Food, Ground Service, Seat Comfort, and Value—based on customer reviews of British Airways. Covering a period from March 2016 to October 2023, this dashboard provides insights into customer satisfaction worldwide, enabling a detailed assessment of British Airways' service quality across different dimensions.

## Data source
The data utilized has been downloaded online through a Youtube Channel called 'Mo Chen' and added to the current repository

## Tools
- Tableau

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Five parameters namely Cabin Staff Service, Entertainment, Food, Ground Service, Seat Comfort, and Value were created and five filters: Date, Seat type, Traveller type, Aircraft and Continent. These parameters and filters should help visualize the overall data by toggling each of them.

## Visualization
The final dashboard for this project consists of four plots: average metric by month, average metric by country, average metric by aircraft, and number of reviews by aircraft. Together, these visualizations provide a comprehensive view of the data, highlighting trends and insights across different dimensions.
